## Introduction
Instacart, an online grocery store already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns.
As an analyst my task was to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

Note: Instacart is a real company thatâ€™s made their data available online. However, the contents of the attached project brief have been fabricated by CareerFoundry for the purpose of this analysis.

## Folder Structure
