## Introduction
Over the course of the past decade, local short-term housing rental services like AirBnB have grown exponentially, becoming an alternative avenue for those seeking a more local and private stay than a traditional hotel can offer. Nowadays, it is common for people to utilize this alternative service to generate additional income by investing in rental properties. However, the rental market is highly region and time-specific, and committing to investing in a rental property is a high-risk decision. This project aims to better understand the Amsterdam AirBnB market to provide insights for prospective AirBnB hosts who have or want to have listings in Amsterdam and want to be informed about general characteristics and trends of listings.

Source: insideairbnb.com, a mission-driven activist project with the objective to provide data that quantifies the impact of short-term rentals on housing and residential communities, as well as create a platform to support advocacy for policies to protect our cities from the impacts of short-term rentals. They collect publicly available data from AirBnBâ€™s website and analyse it themselves
